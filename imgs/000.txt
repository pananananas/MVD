Create an image of a small, floating house with a whimsical and surreal appearance. The house is constructed primarily from a combination of wood and stone, with a dark brown shingled roof and light beige walls. The house is situated on a raised platform with a small garden area, featuring a few potted plants and a small porch with a wooden staircase leading up to it. The overall atmosphere should evoke a sense of warmth and charm.
